For my own reference (and anyone else in case this actually becomes useful):

Haskell + Haskell-Atom Setup

To Download Atom: https://atom.io/. For the most part follow https://atom-haskell.github.io/. 

1. To install Haskell:
Go to https://www.haskell.org/platform/prior.html and download version 8.0.2. The reason for using this older version will become apparent later.

2. Use the command 

```apm install language-haskell ide-haskell ide-haskell-cabal haskell-ghc-mod autocomplete-haskell```

3. Choose between Stack and Cabal:

Which should I choose?
  If you are asking this, probably just go with Stack. It seems to be easier for most things, including getting started. For some   discussion see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30913145/what-is-the-difference-between-cabal-and-stack "Stack Overflow Post"). This may also be helpful https://haskell-lang.org/tutorial/stack-build.
